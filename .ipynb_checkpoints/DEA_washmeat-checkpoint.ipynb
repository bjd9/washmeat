    "# Why people wash meat (or don't)\n",
    "\n",
    "YouTuber (and former public radio reporter) [Adam Ragusea](https://www.youtube.com/user/aragusea/about) [asked his viewers](https://youtu.be/U_PMnCpaJiQ?t=742) in September 2020 to answer a detailed survey about whether (and why and how) they wash meat before cooking it. He received more than 13,000 responses. The data explored and analyzed here is the anomymized data collected. Ragusea published a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90Nd_vh3yk8) explaining more around washing meat and his analysis of the data.\n",
